        <p className="mb-4">
          An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned
          to every device connected to the internet. It allows devices to
          communicate with each other by identifying their network location.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          There are two types of IP addresses: <strong>IPv4</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>IPv6</strong>. IPv4 is the most common and looks like
          192.168.1.1, while IPv6 is newer and provides a much larger address
          space.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your IP address can reveal information such as your approximate
          location, internet service provider (ISP), and more. This tool from{" "}
          <strong>Parcoil</strong> helps you quickly see your public IP and
          related connection details.
